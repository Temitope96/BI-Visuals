## U.S Health Analytics

I leveraged a U.S Health Dataset to perform descriptive analytics, comparing 10 hospitals across patient demographics, prevalence of major health conditions, medical patterns and treatment costs versus insurance providers

## Project Overview
Using the U.S Health Dataset, I created multiple chart/visuals that clearly displays the population demographics by gender, age groups and blood type. This could be drilled through using the Hospital filter (on the Hospital page) as well as the Medical Condition filter (on the Medical Condition page). With this, I was able to uncover insights such as;
- Most populated Hospitals and the most prevalent medical conditions in each hospital as well as the gender spread, 
- Most prevalent medical conditions across each hospital, the effect that blood type had on each individual condition as well as if the gender of patients had any effect on the prevalence of such condition.

This visual also performs a deep-dive into the influence of Insurance Providers across various Hospitals and per medical condition.
